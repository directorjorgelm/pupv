It is a dark night on the Las Vegas strip, as we find ourselves outside a garishly lit wedding chapel. A man in a vibrant green tuxedo stands alone, holding a ruined bouquet of flowers, his face a mask of pure anguish. In a slow, deliberate movement, he looks directly into the camera and with a voice trembling with rage, he says in brazilian portuguese, "Ela me deixou, mas terei a minha vinganÃ§aâ€¦ Vou encontrar aquele homem de terno azul e fazÃª-lo pagar!" 

The location is a classic Vegas chapel, its neon signs casting long, dramatic shadows. The man is heartbroken but resolute, his tuxedo standing in stark contrast to his ruined flowers. The camera begins on a medium shot and slowly pushes in, tightening on his face as he delivers his final, chilling line. 

The scene has a high-contrast, cinematic look, styled after a modern noir thriller, with a color correction that emphasizes the saturated neon colors against the cool, blue-toned shadows of the night.
